I am an Applied Mathematics and Mathematics student at the University of Pretoria. In my spare time I do copy editing and proofreading for the campus news paper.

My interests include a little programming; I would like to see a free and open source mathematical computational system that is easy to use for non-programmers but powerful enough to be extendible.  

Currently I am spending my days learning dynamical systems, numerical analysis, mathematical statistics, linear algebra and historical geology.
