title: Blogging Like a Hacker
---

Hello, World!
=============

After some effort I think I have finally gotten this blogging thing set up.  I've made this platform so that I can showcase some of my projects, write a little and share some of what I know on a more permanent platform.

This site is set up on a Jekyll base hosted on GitHub.  Thanks to Jekyll I can write posts using Markdown, that then gets rendered into HTML.  With some clever tricks from the liquid templating engine, I can then add all the preamble to the posts so that CSS and all the other pretty things get added. Added functionality from the MathJax JavaScript library, I can even render mathematics.  Hopefully this blog will prove interesting and educational to others as well.
